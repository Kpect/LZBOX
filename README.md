**Sorry. Due to various reasons, LZBOX has stopped development. Thank you for your support and expectations, but I am unable to continue with the development. However, I will disclose the source code. The source code is divided into two parts:**
1. Old version UI (feature implemented)
2. New version UI (feature not implemented)

**Project Introduction:**
This is a new online platform for my world. If you are the server owner, you only need to submit the server name and download address to other players to enter your server and play. If you are a player, do you often worry about not being able to find a server to play? Fortunately, you have met LZBOX, who allows you to quickly download server clients and join the server for gaming.

**Room.yml Content:**

```yaml
# This is a Minecraft server list file that contains the names and download links of multiple servers
# Separate the server name and download link with a colon, and separate the name and link with a space
# Example 1: Single Server
Server1: http://example.com/server1.zip
# Example 2: Multiple servers
Server2: http://example.com/server2.zip
Server3: http://example.com/server3.zip
Server4: http://example.com/server4.zip
